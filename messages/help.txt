I came from a long journey to give you some tips!

Here are the fractal sets available for you to explore:
-Mandelbrot
-Julia
-Burning Ship
(Here's a little secret: I like to call them "worlds".)

To explore them, just run one of the commands below according to which world
you want to explore:
./fractol mandelbrot
./fractol julia (need more arguments - more examples below)
./fractol burning-ship

Oh, I almost forgot to tell you, they are not case sensitive, so if you type an
uppercase letter here and a lowercase letter there, don't worry, our onboard
computer will adjust the destination name correctly, but that's only in this
case, in case you miss the name our computer will crash.

To explore Julia's world our on-board computer will need a few more
coordinates, which you can pass as a single string or as two strings, keep in
mind that any coordinates passed in will be ignored by our on-board computer,
and if so pass a wrong coordinate our dear computer will crash too.
Coordinates examples:
./fractol julia "-0.428 -0.580i"
./fractol julia -0.428 -0.580i

After setting the coordinates correctly and hitting the enter button, your life
will not be the same, you will discover beautiful fractals!
For your experience to be even more complete, follow some commands for you to
navigate the ship in this new world full of mysteries:

-	The arrows will make the ship move in the desired direction (up, down,
	left, right).

-	The mouse scroll will make you accelerate or reverse on the ship, where
	scroll up is to accelerate and scroll down is to reverse.

-	You may want to accelerate in a specific direction, without having to
	control with the arrows, for this our latest generation ship has a feature
	where you just place the mouse arrow on the desired direction and
	accelerate and the ship will move to that direction. position.

-	One of the most important parts of any trip is to enjoy all the possible
	landscapes, and for that we have the "c" key where you can change the world
	around you to your liking (unfortunately limited to 6 options).

-	But there is always a time when we want to start a new journey or just go
	home and look at the stars, and for that we have a solution dear human
	friend, the "ESC" button, it will make your journey end (only press if you
	are sure of that).

So that's it my human friend, now it all depends on you and your curiosity for
the unknown!
Have a good trip and see you next time!
